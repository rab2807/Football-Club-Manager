# Football-Club-Manager
 A mock football club manager software which can show player details as well as buy and sell players through network socket.
 
This was the term project of our Object Oriented Programming course. Along with the object oriented code structure, the project also emphasized on multithreading and socket networking.

# Tech Stack and Tools
* JDK 15
* JavaFX
* SceneBuilder
* Java socket programming
* Java multithreading

# Features
* The server has to be initiated first. Then multiple client windows can be started, but one club cannot be logged into more than one window.
* A football club has to log into the system using their user name. If the club is enlisted, then the server will grant access.

* In the Home menu, the club can see its current players and their details. They also have the option to sell a player. When a club sells a player, that player is visible in the Buy menu for the rest of the other clubs to buy.
